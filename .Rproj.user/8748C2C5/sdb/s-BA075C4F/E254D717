Fuzzy Cognitive Map is a combination of fuzzy logic and cognitive mapping, and it is a way to represent knowledge of systems which are characterized of uncertainty and complex processes. FCMs were introduced by Kosko and since then they have gradually emerged as a powerful paradigm for knowledge representation. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps are ideal causal cognition tools for modeling and simulating dynamic systems.\nLicense: GPL-2\nEncoding: UTF-8\nLazyData: true\nRoxygenNote: 6.0.1\nImports: reshape2, ggplot2\n#Repository: CRAN\n",
