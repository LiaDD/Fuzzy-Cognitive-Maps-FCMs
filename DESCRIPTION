Description: The fcm package includes the fcm.infer function which returns a dataframe of the concepts' values of each state after the inference procedure. Fuzzy Cognitive Map is a combination of fuzzy logic and cognitive mapping, and it is a way to represent knowledge of systems which are characterized of uncertainty and complex processes. FCMs were introduced by Kosko and since then they have gradually emerged as a powerful paradigm for knowledge representation. FCMs are ideal causal cognition tools for modeling and simulating dynamic systems.
